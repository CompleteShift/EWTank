alright lemme just type for a bit
this is quickly becoming more complex than I want
I want to simplify this
excel requires a lot of thinking I don't want to do
a programming language may allow me to automate a lot of the thinking
I can make it more verbose if I want to
python is probably best because it keeps it simple for prototyping
just use python
java and c# will add a lot of complexity I don't want
never mind I'm more familiar with Java let's just do that

alright how do I want this to work
I want the program to iterate through a timeline
and show a bunch of variables for each point in the timeline
I can have it print those variables after each event in the timeline
I want the events in the timeline to happen in a specific order

A simulation has a timeline
this timeline has events in it
events can have many things
- a name
- a potency

okay let's dial down on what events actually are
They must have a name
they must have a time
they can have a potency
they can have a healing potency
they can regenerate mana
they can add a shell
they can add beast gauge
they can add blood gauge

Can I use the same simulation class for all 4 tanks?
They all have vastly different things
I should probably create a separate class for each simulation
simulations will have some similarities though
they all have timelines
simulation should be some sort of interface I guess
fuck that for now
separate classes

Is the timeline anything other than a list?  Who knows.
